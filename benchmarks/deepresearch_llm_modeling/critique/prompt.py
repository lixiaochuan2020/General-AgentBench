## Critique

critique_prompt_1 = """
You are an analyst expert evaluating multiple attempts of multi-step trajectories of a search agent for answering the same question using search tools. You will be provided with:
1. The entire trajectories
2. The corresponding evaluation results
3. The question
4. The ground truth

The agent's valid actions:
1. <search> query </search>: search the web for information
2. <answer> answer </answer>: output the final answer
3. <summary> important parts of the history turns </summary>: summarize the history turns.

Its search results are provided in <information> and </information> tags in the Environment Feedback section.

Your task is to provide a generalizable lesson for answering this question based on these attempts. 

Please do the following:
1. Carefully analyze all the trajectories.
2. Identify common mistakes that led to incorrect answers, and highlight behaviors that led to correct answers (if any).
3. Summarize your feedback as a generalizable lesson: what mistake(s) is the model likely to repeat in future attempts, and how to avoid them.

Important:
The model will not have access to its past trajectories in future attempts, so your feedback must be self-contained and explanatory.
