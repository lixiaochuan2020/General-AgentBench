## Automatic Generation for MathHay

Run the following commands to install dependencies:
```sh
pip install openai
pip install pydantic
pip install tavily-python
pip install spacy
pip install pandas
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-core
pip install nltk
pip install tiktoken
pip install google
pip install boto3

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Set up environment variables:
```sh
export TAVILY_API_KEY=""
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
export PYTHONPATH="."
```

To generate MathHay data, use:
```sh
sh scripts/bench_generation.sh March-2024-to-September-2024 2 2 2
```
where assigned input arguments are time, number of topics, number of subtopics, and number of queries.

## Evaluations on MathVista

Run the evaluation command:
```sh
sh scripts/evaluation.sh March-2024-to-September-2024 sssd gpt-4o 32000 middle full
```
where assigned input arguments are time, task type, models to be evaluated, input length, placement, and dataset choice.
